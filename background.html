            <p>The reasoning behind why I created a website about <strong>Water</strong> was simply because I love it. Currently at home, there is a drought. However, we are almost 2/3 into Autumn and now it is starting to rain thankfully.</p>
            <p>Water means a lot to me. Having a full tank means I can have a shower, my goats gets water, the farm doesn't look all sad and dead and all those other things mentioned in the page. I just love water.</p>
            <p>This past year has been the worst its ever been for rainfall. We had half the average rainfall. Is this one glimpse into climate change?</p>
            <p>I can't wait for it to rain more! More rain, more grass. More grass, more life.</p>
